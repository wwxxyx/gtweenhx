<h2>Description</h2>
A port of <a href='http://gskinner.com/libraries/gtween/'>GTween</a>, a tweening and animation library originally written in AS3 (Flash), into haXe. haXe is a multi-target language (Flash/JS/C++, and more). GTweenHX is intended to support all haXe targets with plugins specifically geared toward Flash, JS (jeash), and C++ (hxcpp/nme).


<h3>Implemented</h3><li>GTween</li><li>GTweener</li><li>GTweenTimeline</li><li>Easing classes</li><li>Plugins</li>


<h4>Notes</h4><li>GTweenHX currently does not implement the Proxy feature of GTween. If anyone has input on how to implement it in any or all targets it would be welcome.</li><li>All plugins are implemented, however integration with hxcpp/nme and jeash is not seamless since some of their features are currently implemented in a different manner from Flash, or not implemented at all.</li><li>This project is also available as a <a href='http://lib.haxe.org/p/GTweenHX'>haxelib</a></li>
